## Role Overview

Developed ML-powered features and optimized backend systems for art market intelligence platform serving thousands of users worldwide.

## Key Achievements

- **Reverse Image Search**: Built a FAISS-based vector database for reverse image search to enable similarity retrieval using an ensemble of pHash and CNN embeddings

- **Revenue-Driving Feature**: Developed and deployed the backend and data pipeline for the "Repeated Sales of Artworks" feature which resulted in a 200% increase in customer convergence rates

- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized the core near-duplicate image detection algorithm by implementing parallelization, caching, efficient SQL queries, and strategic performance tuning, reducing runtime by 75%

- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Collaborated with cross-functional teams to troubleshoot, diagnose, and resolve code issues and bugs

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **ML/CV**: FAISS, CNNs, pHash, OpenCV
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **Optimization**: Parallelization, Caching
- **Domains**: Computer Vision, Image Similarity, ML Engineering

## Impact

Delivered features that directly increased customer engagement by 200% while reducing system runtime by 75% through strategic optimization. Built scalable vector search infrastructure handling thousands of art image queries daily.
