[{"content":"Introduction ","permalink":"https://simrankc.com.np/blog/test/","summary":"Introduction ","title":"Test blog"},{"content":"Description Developed and implemented an HTTPS and WebSocket proxy to the backend of KuberIDE in FastAPI for user tracking. Integrated Github/Google OAuth to KuberIDE, streamlining the authentication process for users and reducing login errors. Added an Intellisense feature to the online IDE using HLS, improving the code editing experience for users and reducing the time spent on debugging. Contributed to the development of new features in the Vue.js application. Designed and developed dynamically generated smart contracts based on user parameters for Payment Splitter. Utilized metadata and reference script to develop a backend-less application for Payment Splitter, reducing server load and improving scalability. Developed a Discord Cardano Bot that automatically transfers NFTs to server members based on their credit, resulting in a reduction in manual NFT transfers. Serialized NFT transfer using Celery and Redis, enabling high-volume, asynchronous transfers and reducing processing time.
