## Role Overview

Contributing to NASA's Accelerated Knowledge Discovery project, developing a deep research LLM agent enhanced with human-in-the-loop guidance for scientific exploration.

## Key Achievements

- **ML Pipeline Development**: Fine-tuned and integrated FastText and RoBERTa classifiers on large scientific text corpora to implement a multi-model automated tagging pipeline and relevancy-checking classifier for scraped documents, reducing manual curation time by 95%

- **Integration with NASA Systems**: Integrated models into NASA's Science Discovery Engine to enable ML-assisted content curation workflows

- **Scalable Inference Pipeline**: Developed a scalable inference pipeline in Python and FastAPI to serve multiple models through a single API in a resource-constrained environment

- **Distributed Processing**: Implemented a Redis-backed queue for batch processing, with loosely coupled distributed workers that dynamically load and unload models to optimize resources and scale horizontally

- **Testing & Quality**: Added Pytest unit and integration tests to improve reliability and maintainability

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **ML/NLP**: RoBERTa, FastText, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Infrastructure**: Redis, Docker
- **Testing**: Pytest
- **Domains**: Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Scientific Text Analysis

## Impact

Reduced manual data curation time by 95% through automated ML pipelines, enabling NASA scientists to focus on research rather than data management. Built scalable infrastructure that can handle large volumes of scientific documents while optimizing resource usage in constrained environments.
